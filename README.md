# **B**ayesian **A**ugmentation by **C**hained **E**quations (**BACE**)

**B**ayesian **A**ugmentation by **C**hained **E**quations (**BACE**) is a package that allows users to used chained equations to impute missing data for incomplete comparative datasets. It allows multiple random effect levels (phylogeny and species) to be used to imputing missing data, including random slopes. It uses Bayesian models to estimate missing values across the data. 

*BACE* is currently under active development and should not be used untils further testing has been done.
