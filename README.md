# **B**ayesian **A**ugmentation by **C**hained **E**quations (**BACE**) or BASE with phylogeny (Phylo-BASE)

**B**ayesian **A**ugmentation by **C**hained **E**quations (**BACE**) is a package that allows users to used chained equations to impute missing data for incomplete comparative datasets using phylogenetic information (so more correctly, **Phylo-BACE**). It allows multiple random effect levels (phylogeny and species) to be used to imputing missing data, including random slopes. It uses Bayesian models to estimate missing values across the data. 

*Phylo-BACE* is currently under active development and should not be used until further testing has been done.
