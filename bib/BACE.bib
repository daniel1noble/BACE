  abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) enable us to study the history of organismal evolution and diversification. PCMs comprise a collection of statistical methods for inferring history from piecemeal information, primarily combining two types of data: first, an estimate of species relatedness, usually based on their genes, and second, contemporary trait values of extant organisms. Some PCMs also incorporate information from geological records, especially fossils, but also other gradual and episodic events in the Earth's history (for example, trait data from fossils or the global oxygen concentration as an independent variable). It is important to note at the outset that PCMs are not concerned with reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among species; this has to do with estimating the phylogeny from genetic, fossil and other data, and a separate set of methods for this process makes up the field of phylogenetics. PCMs as a set of methods are distinct from, but are not completely independent of, phylogenetics. PCMs are used to address the questions: how did the characteristics of organisms evolve through time and what factors influenced speciation and extinction?},

Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

These resources permit many open questions in comparative biology to be addressed with the right statistical tools. Multi-response (MR) phylogenetic mixed models (PMMs) offer great potential for multivariate analyses of trait evolution. While flexible and powerful, these methods are not often employed by researchers in ecology and evolution, reflecting a specialised and technical literature that creates barriers to usage for many biologists. Here we present a practical and accessible guide to MR-PMMs. We begin with a review of single-response (SR) PMMs to introduce key concepts and outline the limitations of this approach for characterising patterns of trait coevolution. We emphasise MR-PMMs as a preferable approach for analyses involving multiple species traits, due to the explicit decomposition of trait covariances. We discuss multilevel models, multivariate models of evolution, and extensions to non-Gaussian response traits. We highlight techniques for causal inference using graphical models, as well as advanced topics including prior specification and latent factor models. Using simulated data and visual examples, we discuss interpretation, prediction, and model validation. We implement many of the techniques discussed in example analyses of plant functional traits to demonstrate the general utility of MR-PMMs in handling complex real-world data sets. Finally, we discuss the emerging synthesis of comparative techniques made possible by MR-PMMs, highlight strengths and weaknesses, and offer practical recommendations to analysts. To complement this material, we provide online tutorials including side-by-side model implementations in two popular R packages, MCMCglmm and brms.},

  abstract = {Here, by consolidating and extending simple models of how genetic robustness affects the evolvability of phenotypes with discrete states, I uncover three new insights. (i) Environmental robustness can boost evolvability by allowing populations to spread across a migrationally neutral network of demes, thereby increasing the diversity of plastic phenotypes that can be accessed by migration. (ii) Counter-intuitively, when adaptive landscapes are complex, an increase in environmental stability can increase the frequency of environmentally robust but mutationally sensitive genotypes. This appears to be due to relaxed selection for mutational robustness in generalists. (iii) Evolvability can be affected by changes in mutational sensitivity, or by changes in the neighborhood of phenotypes accessible by non-neutral mutations. Because it allows for the evolution of increased evolvability without a concomitant increase in genetic load, selection should favor changes in the phenotypic neighborhood over changes in mutational sensitivity. Moreover, with fluctuating selection, the potential gains in evolvability conferred by increased mutational sensitivity can be diminished by selective sweeps on the phenotypic neighborhood.},

This line of reasoning suggests that organisms must have special properties to overcome this cost, such as integration, modularity, and robustness, and that the reduction in the rate of evolution and variational constraints could help explain why organisms might not respond to selection. Here, we discuss the issues that arise from this conviction and highlight an alternative view where complexity represents an opportunity by increasing the evolutionary potential of a population. We highlight the lack of evidence supporting the influence of complexity on evolvability. Empirical data on the patterns of contemporary selection are critical for understanding this relationship.

This study examines how heterogeneous populations adapt under varying mutation rates ({$\mu$}) and fitness landscape ruggedness (K), emphasizing their distinct starting conditions in valleys, slopes (low prominence), or peaks (high prominence). Using an extended NK model, we simulate populations capable of initiating anywhere in the landscape. Our findings reveal that starting positions strongly influence whether robustness or evolvability is advantageous. Populations beginning in low-prominence regions (valleys and slopes) exhibited high levels of epistasis ({$\epsilon$}) and pleiotropy ({$\pi$}), enhancing evolvability and enabling exploration of the fitness landscape. In contrast, populations starting in high-prominence regions (peaks) reduced {$\epsilon$} and {$\pi$}, prioritizing robustness to maintain stability against mutations. This study highlights the role of starting conditions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, offering insights into the interplay between evolvability and robustness.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), especially ones based on linear models, have played a central role in understanding species' trait evolution. These methods, however, usually assume that phylogenetic trees are known without error or uncertainty, but this assumption is most likely incorrect. So far, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian methods have mainly been deployed to account for such ``phylogenetic uncertainty'' in PCMs. Herein, we propose an approach with which phylogenetic uncertainty is incorporated in a simple, readily implementable and reliable manner. Our approach uses Rubin's rules, which are an integral part of a standard multiple imputation procedure, often employed to recover missing data. We see true phylogenetic trees as missing data under this approach. Further, unmeasured species in comparative data (i.e., missing trait data) can be seen as another source of uncertainty in PCMs because arbitrary sampling of species in a given taxon or ``species sampling uncertainty'' can affect estimation in PCMs. Using two simulation studies, we show our method can account for phylogenetic uncertainty under many different scenarios (e.g., uncertainty in topology and branch lengths) and, at the same time, it can handle missing trait data (i.e., species sampling uncertainty). A unique property of the multiple imputation procedure is that an index, named ``relative efficiency,'' could be used to quantify the number of trees required for incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty. Thus, by using the relative efficiency, we show the required tree number is surprisingly small (\textbackslash sim50 trees). However, the most notable advantage of our method is that it could be combined seamlessly with PCMs that utilize multiple imputation to handle simultaneously phylogenetic uncertainty (i.e., missing true trees) and species sampling uncertainty (i.e., missing trait data) in PCMs.},
