\title{pool_posteriors}
\usage{
pool_posteriors(bace_final_object, variable = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bace_final_object}{An object of class 'bace_final' from bace_final_imp}

\item{variable}{Character string specifying which variable's model to pool.
If NULL (default), pools all variables}
}
\value{
A list of class 'bace_pooled' containing pooled models for each variable.
Each pooled model is an MCMCglmm object with class c("MCMCglmm", "bace_pooled_MCMCglmm")
containing:
\itemize{
\item Sol: Pooled fixed effect posteriors (combined across imputations)
\item VCV: Pooled variance component posteriors (combined across imputations)
\item CP: Pooled cutpoint posteriors (for categorical/ordinal models, if present)
\item Liab: Pooled latent variables (for categorical models, if present)
\item DIC: Mean DIC across imputations
\item Deviance: Combined deviance samples
\item BACE_pooling: Metadata about pooling (n_imputations, n_samples_per_imputation, etc.)
\item All other MCMCglmm components (Fixed, Random, etc.)
}
}
\description{
Pool posteriors from multiple imputation runs to account for imputation uncertainty
}
\details{
This function implements posterior pooling by concatenating MCMC samples
from all imputation runs. This naturally accounts for both within-imputation and
between-imputation variance. The resulting MCMCglmm object can be used with
standard MCMCglmm methods like print() and summary(), which will display results
that properly reflect uncertainty from both the model and the imputation process.

The pooled models retain the MCMCglmm class so all standard MCMCglmm methods work,
but also include class "bace_pooled_MCMCglmm" for custom behavior when needed.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running bace_final_imp
final <- bace_final_imp(bace_obj, ...)
pooled <- pool_posteriors(final)

# Extract pooled model for specific variable - works like MCMCglmm!
pooled_y <- pooled$y
summary(pooled_y)  # Standard MCMCglmm summary
print(pooled_y)    # Standard MCMCglmm print
plot(pooled_y)     # Standard MCMCglmm plots
}
