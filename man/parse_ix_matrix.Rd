\title{Parse interaction matrix to extract interaction pairs}
\usage{
parse_ix_matrix(ix_matrix, var_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{ix_matrix}{Square matrix with interaction codes (lower triangular)}

\item{var_names}{Character vector of variable names (predictors + response)}
}
\value{
Named list where each element contains interaction pairs for that variable
}
\description{
Decodes the interaction matrix to identify which variables interact.
The matrix uses integer codes where variables sharing the same non-zero integer
in a row form an interaction. Returns a list of interaction pairs for each row.
}
\examples{
# ix_matrix:
# 0 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 0
# 1 1 0 0
# 1 1 2 0
# For x3: x1:x2 (both have code 1)
# For y: x1:x2 (code 1), x1:x3 (code 2 - wait, 1 and 2 share code? No.)
# Correction: For row 4 (y): columns with same integer interact
# 1,2 share '1' -> x1:x2; columns 1,3 have 1,2 -> no shared code
# Actually: row 4 is [1, 1, 2, 0] -> x1 and x2 share '1' -> x1:x2
# x1 has 1, x3 has 2 -> different codes, no interaction
# Hmm, user example says "1 interacts with 3 (share a 2)" but col1=1, col3=2
# Re-reading: "12" in position [4,1] means digit 1 AND digit 2
# So [12, 1, 2, 0] means x1 has codes {1,2}, x2 has {1}, x3 has {2}
# x1 shares 1 with x2 -> x1:x2; x1 shares 2 with x3 -> x1:x3
